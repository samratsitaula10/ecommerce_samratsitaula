# OBJECTIVES:


    * To prepare our environment, and run a simple project.
    * To install the necessary software for the project.


# INTRODUCTION:
    
    Python is a programming language with a high level of abstraction. It is a straightforward and simple programming language. It is the world's most popular programming language. Django is a free and open-source backend web framework built on Python. We're implementing DBeaver, a SQL client software program and database administration tool in our project. Our IDE is Visual Studio Code (Integrated Development Environment).


# PROCEDURE:
    
    - install the latest python version.
    - install the latest Django version.
    - install the SqliteDB for the database.
    - install the BDeaver community edition for a database tool.
    - create a GitHub account.
    - link the GitHub with VScode by cloning the repository.
    - create a module in Django.
    - create a database.
    - create the superuser using the 'python manage.py create superuser code.
    - run the server of Django using ' python manage.py run-server code.
    - we go to the corresponding link on our website to verify the respective changes.



# CONCLUSION:
    
    Hence, we learned the steps needed to run the server in Django and use the different software to start a web-based project using python and Django.
